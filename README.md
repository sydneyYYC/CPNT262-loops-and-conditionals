Had lots of errors and debugging with the first problem
 capitalization problems
 so this gives us an uppercase first letter of each but the problem is it returns undefined with the first letter
// for (let i = 0; i < newArr.length; i++) {
//   newArr[i] = newArr[i][0].toUpperCase();
//   console.log(newArr);

returns "Bundefined, Jundefined"

this doesnt join the words correctly - nor does it use MAP correctly which was throwing errors
//split into two words and invoke the function across all words
// const newArr = jelly.split(" ").map(capitalizeFirstLetter);
//join words with a space
// const capitalizeJelly = newArr.join(" ");
